# Internships 2025 List

This is a website that I've created using Express.js and Firebase as Database. The main purpose was to learn how to make a server using node.js for the backend and my knowledge in HTML, CSS, and Javascript for the Frontend. This site contains all the CRUD operations and you can visit it by clicking <a href="https://internship-list-rosy.vercel.app/">here</a>.
